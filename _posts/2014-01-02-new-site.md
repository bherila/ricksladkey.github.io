Here my notes for installing Jekyll on Windows for use with GitHub Pages.

* Basic installation for Ruby 2.0.0 x64, including DevKit [here](http://yizeng.me/2013/05/10/setup-jekyll-on-windows/)

With Cygwin installed, and it is later in the PATH than ruby, Liquid gets confused about whether it can execute python2.  Give in and let it do that:

    cd C:\Python27
    type python2.bat
    @%~dp0\python.exe %*
