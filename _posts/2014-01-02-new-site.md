Here my notes for installing Jekyll on Windows for use with GitHub Pages.

* Basic installation for Ruby 2.0.0 x64, including DevKit [here](http://yizeng.me/2013/05/10/setup-jekyll-on-windows/)

With Cygwin python installed, and its bin folder later in the PATH than the native python, Liquid gets confused about whether it can execute python2.  Give in and let it do that:

    cd C:\Python27
    type python2.bat
    @%~dp0\python.exe %*
